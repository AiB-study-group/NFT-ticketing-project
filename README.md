## **Project Description**

A simple MVP dApp to provide a blockchain based ticketing system for event managers (physical or virtual) to allow their users to have an easy to use and accessible proof of attendance mechanism. This system will allow event managers to fight ticket counterfeiting, to track their tickets, and to allow tools to be used to manage the community around the event itself and offer unique experiences for every ticket holder, if they wish to.

## **What are NFT Tickets**

* NFT tickets are just tickets, but with a twist. NFT tickets are immutables, they can't be counterfeited, they can easily be tracked to their original owner and current owner.
* The NFT Ticket in itself is a special permission grated by the owner of the event for example to the ticket holder/s for future happenings or any special experience the owner will be specifying.

## **Problem NFT Tickets are Solving**

1. Public and trustless proof of attendance

2. Traceability

3. Anti-counterfeited tickets

4. Making community management tools easily available

## **Case Studies**

1. **Virtual Gatherings**
   * NFT tickets can easily enable virtual gathering to occur, and can easily enable tools to be built around every special event. Like for example, having a bot that drops a link for the attendees to math their connected wallets to the ticket available in it, and proof that they've already been attending.

2. **Gaming**
   * NFT tickets can enable gaming companies to have in-game capabilities for gamers who achieve certain level of commitment, or for gamers who have finished certain levels in the game, etc. And have those people who claim the NFT to have a special gathering, or meeting for example. The possibilities here are endless.

3. **Physical Meetings / Conferences**
   * Companies may allow their loyal customers to have special experiences or have them attend NFT holders only sessions for example.

4. **And much much more examples can be easily enabled by using NFTs as a way for tickets**
